                   (iii)start: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.
                   (iv)end: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.
                   (v)left: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.
                   (vi)right: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like end.
                   (vii)center: items are centered along the line
                   (viii)space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
                   (ix)space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
                   (x)space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

                        (ii)flex-start / start: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.
                        (iii)flex-end / end: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.

                        (v)space-between: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
